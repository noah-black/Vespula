Digital synthesizer

1. Install the libasound2-dev package (Ubuntu : sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev)
2. Install Qt 4 (Ubuntu : sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools)
3. Generate the Makefile with the qmake command.
4. Use the make command to build the 'synth' executable file.

The keyboard may be used to play notes. 

The keys are laid out like a piano.

Think of the home row as the white keys, and the row above it as the black keys.
